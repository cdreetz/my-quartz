Title: Products and Feelings

## The Senses

There is a concept that is spoken in almost all industries but often thought of from the perspective of many different angles.  In business, it is common to hear the need to think of things from a business perspective, think of the value add, on product teams you might hear the term product sense, in other domains like marketing you have to understand the customers perspective, and designers consider the emotion that is felt with certain visuals.  What might sound like a range of different concepts or skills that are specific to any given profession, in reality they all boil down to empathy.  Every single one of these specialized problems is solved by putting yourself in the shoes of others, by being able to understand and share the feelings of other people.  

There is no such thing as product sense, products do not matter without people, and understanding how people use products is what is really important.  The same goes for having a business sense, business problems are merely people problems, which become much more clear when you can put yourself in the customers position, business owners' positions, or your boss's position.  If you are working at a company, there is no standardized way to determine value add, how much you value an output or some form of work does not matter.  The actual consideration is from the perspective of stakeholders, what is the impact or value add of your work or outcome, which may not align with how you would personally value something.  The idea applies for people no matter what domain, industry, or even your specific role.  

Having a strong sense of empathy is what opens up the world, and without it life would be far more narrow and shallow.  


## Innate Ability

What makes these concepts such reoccurring things in a lot of professional lives, is the fact that it is a common problem with no real solution.  You can Google articles on how to think about products or how to understand your customers, but it's all bullshit.  There is no secret and there for sure is absolutely no blog post that will open your eyes to the mechanisms of the human brain.  In my not so professional opinion, I believe empathy is an innate trait or at the least something that is learned and embedded in people at a very young age.  I think some adults might be able to try really hard to learn it, and may figure out a way to emulate it, but for an adult who has spent their entire life not practicing or naturally being deeply empathetic, it is close to impossible to develop.

## Double Edged 

In one last section, I want to clarify what someone with these traits might resemble.  Just having an ability to be empathetic and understand others feelings, does not imply this person is a nice or positive person.  Most people associate empathy as a trait of a 'good' person or a nice person, but a successful 'bad' or 'evil' person has to have a strong sense of empathy just as much.
