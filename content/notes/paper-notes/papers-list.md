[Retrieval meets Long Context Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03025)

[ChNeMo: Domain-Adapted LLMs for Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00176)

[Long Text and Multi-table Summarization: Dataset and Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03815)
Is grouping done arbitrarily?  If taking the mean of H heads, is it not possible to ensure that all H heads in each group are the ones most similar to eachother?  PCA for heads?

[FlashAttention-2: Faster Attnetion with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691)
