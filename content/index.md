I like all things related to building. Building software, building companies, building actual buildings.

Currently senior data engineer.  Mostly interested in MLE and MLOps focused projects.

Previously AI engineer, lead the development of a number of RAG based chat applications, while supporting projects on new search capabilities, new recommendation systems, and put together the infrastrucutre to support them all.
